This code corresponds to paper "Low-complexity end-to-end deep learning framework for 100G-PON" published in Journal of Optical Communications and Networking.
The "train_E2E.py" in the TrainCode file is the main function for the proposed end-to-end learning process, it cannot be run directly and requires the user to write a channel function based on their experimental system.
The TestCode file contains part of the experimental data and test code. Running "test_E2E.py" will give some of the results of the end-to-end learning experiment demonstrated in this paper.
